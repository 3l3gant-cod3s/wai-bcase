<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The justification to commit resources to a project is often called a "business case". Business cases usually document an analysis of a project's value in meeting the organization's objectives, the cost-benefit analysis, and the expected outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Websites&quot; through this document includes web applications and is applicable to other digital technology.</p>

<h3 id="your-org">For Your Organization</h3>

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>Accessibility benefits organizations in many different ways. Whether your organization is a large for-profit corporation, a small retail or service provider, a school or university, a government entity, or a non-profit organization, you can realize significant benefits from implementing accessibility throughout your organization.</p>
<p>An effective business case focuses on your organization's objectives and motivations. Certain aspects of the business case for web accessibility are more important to different organizations. For example, one organization's motivation might be to demonstrate social responsibility by being inclusive of people with disabilities, while another organization's primary motivation might be technical quality and meeting international standards. This resource highlights some aspects of the business case for web accessibility that you can use to create a custom business case for your particular situation.</p>

<h2 id="allusers">Accessibility Benefits All Users</h2>

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

Web accessibility also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities. For example:
<ul>
 <li>people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</li>
 <li>older people with changing abilities due to ageing</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;temporary disabilities&rdquo; such as a broken arm or lost glasses</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;situational limitations&rdquo; such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio</li>
 <li>people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth, which is common in some rural areas and geographical regions</li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="brand">Impact Brand Reputation</h2>

Accessibility can significantly impact your organization's reputation.

An accessible website can garner positive attention from people with disabilities and others. It can get accolades as being a high quality website that meets international web standards. Some organizations actively promote accessibility as a business differentiator.

Conversely, if an organization's website has accessibility problems, it can get negative publicity from news publications and on social media.

By transcribing its library of radio shows [This American Life] TAL increased the number of unique visitors to its website by 4.18%. The number of unique visitors who discovered TAL through organic search results increased by 6.68%. The results showed that 7.23% of website visitors engaged with the transcripts. The results also showed that transcripts provide an effective way to increase authority through additional inbound links. In fact, 405 out of 10,826 external inbound links point to one of the transcript pages. This represents a 3.89% increase in inbound links directly attributable to the transcript pages.

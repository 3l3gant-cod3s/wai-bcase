<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The justification to commit resources to a project is often called a "business case". Business cases usually document an analysis of a project's value in meeting the organization's objectives, the cost-benefit analysis, and the expected outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="allusers">Accessibility Benefits All Users</h3>
<p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Web accessibility also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities, for example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</li>
 <li>older people with changing abilities due to ageing</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;temporary disabilities&rdquo; such as a broken arm or lost glasses</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;situational limitations&rdquo; such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio</li>
 <li>people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth, which is common in some rural areas and geographical regions</li>
 </ul>

<h3 id="your-org">[+] For Your Organization</h3>
<p>Accessibility benefits organizations in many different ways. Whether your organization is a large for-profit corporation, a small retail or service provider, a school or university, a government entity, or a non-profit organization, you can realize significant benefits from implementing accessibility throughout your organization.</p>
<p>An effective business case focuses on your organization's objectives and motivations. Certain aspects of the business case for web accessibility are more important to different organizations. For example, one organization's motivation might be to demonstrate social responsibility by being inclusive of people with disabilities, while another organization's primary motivation might be technical quality and meeting international standards. This resource highlights some aspects of the business case for web accessibility that you can use to create a custom business case for your particular situation.</p>
<h2 id="brand">Impact Brand Reputation</h2>
<p>Accessibility can significantly impact your organization's reputation.</p>
<p>An accessible website can garner positive attention from people with disabilities and others. It can get accolades as being a high quality website that meets international web standards. [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">WCAG</a>), which is also <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/10/wcag-20-is-now-also-isoiec-405/">ISO/IEC 40500</a>]</p>
<p>Some organizations actively promote their accessibility as a @@[key promotion of how good they are]. [ref Barclays, and lots more]</p>
<p>Conversely, if an organization's website has accessibility problems, it can get negative publicity from news publications and on social media.</p>
<h2 id="ux">Impact Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Accessibility can positively impact how satisfied users are with your website &mdash; including users with disabilities and without disabilities.</p>
<p>Conversely, accessibility problems will likely negatively impact user satisfaction for people with disabilities and for people without disabilities in various situations such as using their phone in bright sunlight and others <a href="#allusers">listed above</a>.</p>
<h2 id="market">Increase Market Reach</h2>
<p>Globally, the extended market of people with disabilities and their immediate community is estimated at 2.3 billion people, who control an estimated $6.9 trillion in annual disposable income. [<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gaudianohunt/2016/10/31/richard-branson-supports-disabilities/#3fe3d1d8788e">Forbes.com</a>]</p>
<p>Older users are an important target audience for many websites. Accessible websites work better for &quot;seniors&quot; and elderly people. [ref- WAI's older users page]</p>
<p>Accessible websites also reach people <em>without</em> disabilities in various situations, such as those <a href="#allusers">listed above</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion">Support Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>Many organizations realize the benefits of a diverse and inclusive workforce. To support employees with disabilities, the technology that employees use needs to be accessible, including websites and applications.</p>
<h2 id="innovation">Drive Innovation</h2>
<p>Designing products to meet the needs of people with disabilities often leads to innovative solutions that work better for all users. [proof]</p>
<h2 id="lower-expenses">Decrease Expenses</h2>
<p>Accessible websites can decrease expenses. For example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Decrease cost of alternative format materials</li>
 <li> Decrease cost of translating material</li>
 <li> Decrease personnel costs [proof]</li>
 </ul>
<h2 id="risk">Minimize Financial and Legal Risk</h2>
<p>Some organizations have faced legal action for not making their websites accessible. Minimizing financial and legal risk is a primary driver for many organizations to commit to making their technology accessible.</p>
<p>Some websites are required by law to be accessible. For a list of governmental laws and policies relating to web accessibility in countries and regions around the world, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/">Web Accessibility Laws &amp; Policies</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the legal requirements for an organization might not be clear. Some organizations determine that it is in their best interest to make their websites accessible, rather than risk legal action.</p>

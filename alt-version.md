<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The justification to commit resources to a project is often called a "business case". Business cases usually document an analysis of a project's value in meeting the organization's objectives, the cost-benefit analysis, and the expected outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Websites&quot; through this document includes web applications and is applicable to other digital technology.</p>

<h3 id="allusers">Accessibility Benefits All Users</h3>

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

Web accessibility also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities[^without]. For example:
<ul>
 <li>people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</li>
 <li>older people with changing abilities due to ageing</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;temporary disabilities&rdquo; such as a broken arm or lost glasses</li>
 <li>people with &ldquo;situational limitations&rdquo; such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio</li>
 <li>people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth, which is common in some rural areas and geographical regions</li>
 </ul>

[^without]: Specific examples of how accessibility requirements benefit users without disabilities are in [Web Accessibility Benefits People With and Without Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#groups).

<p>This 7&#189;-minute video shows the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations:</p>

<h3 id="your-org">For Your Organization</h3>

{% include_cached excol.html type="middle" %}

<p>Accessibility benefits organizations in many different ways. Whether your organization is a large for-profit corporation, a small retail or service provider, a school or university, a government entity, or a non-profit organization, you can realize significant benefits from implementing accessibility throughout your organization.</p>
<p>An effective business case focuses on your organization's objectives and motivations. Certain aspects of the business case for web accessibility are more important to different organizations. For example, one organization's motivation might be to demonstrate social responsibility by being inclusive of people with disabilities, while another organization's primary motivation might be technical quality and meeting international standards. This resource highlights some aspects of the business case for web accessibility that you can use to create a custom business case for your particular situation.</p>

{% include_cached excol.html type="end" %}

<h2 id="brand">Impact Brand Reputation</h2>

Accessibility can significantly impact your organization's reputation.

An accessible website can garner positive attention from people with disabilities and others. It can get accolades as being a high quality website that meets international web standards. [^wcag]

[^wcag]: The international web standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">WCAG</a>) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is also <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/10/wcag-20-is-now-also-isoiec-405/">ISO/IEC 40500</a>.

Some organizations actively promote accessibility as a business differentiator.[^promo]

[^promo]: @@ Sharron's write up, Barclays case study, maybe Lainey's list…
 
Conversely, if an organization's website has accessibility problems, it can get negative publicity from news publications and on social media.

<h2 id="ux">Impact Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Accessibility can positively impact how satisfied users are with your website &mdash; including users with disabilities and without disabilities.</p>
<p>Conversely, accessibility problems will likely negatively impact user satisfaction for people with disabilities and for people without disabilities in various situations such as using their phone in bright sunlight and others in <a href="#allusers"> Accessibility Benefits All Users above</a>.</p>

<h2 id="market">Increase Market Reach</h2>

Globally, the extended market of people with disabilities and their immediate community is estimated at 2.3 billion people, who control an estimated $6.9 trillion in annual disposable income.[^stats]

[^stats]: Statistics from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gaudianohunt/2016/10/31/richard-branson-supports-disabilities/#3fe3d1d8788e">Forbes.com : Richard Branson Supports People With Disabilities -- Here Are Six Ways You Can Do It, Too</a>

Older users are an important target audience for many websites. Accessible websites work better for &quot;seniors&quot; and elderly people. [^older] 

[^older]: Examples of how accessibility requirements improve the user experience of older users is in [Older Users and Web Accessibility: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/).

Accessible websites also reach people <em>without</em> disabilities in various situations, such as those in <a href="#allusers">Accessibility Benefits All Users above</a>.

<h2 id="inclusion">Support Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
Many organizations realize the benefits of a diverse and inclusive workforce. [^dni] To support employees with disabilities, the technology that employees use needs to be accessible, including websites and applications.

[^dni]: For information about the business benefits of diversity and inclusion, see [@@ Sharron's write up on diversity and inclusion](@@)


<h2 id="innovation">Drive Innovation</h2>

Designing products to meet the needs of people with disabilities often leads to innovative solutions that work better for all users. [^innovation]

[^innovation]: For information about accessibility driving innovation, see [info such as https://w3c.github.io/wai-bcase/business-case/drive-innovation/]

<h2 id="lower-expenses">Decrease Expenses</h2>
Accessible websites can decrease expenses.[^2] For example:
<ul>
 <li>Decrease cost of alternative format materials</li>
 <li>Decrease cost of translating material</li>
 <li>Decrease personnel costs</li>
 </ul>

[^2]: Specific examples of how accessibility can decrease expenses are in [Direct Cost Savings]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/fin#direct).

<h2 id="risk">Minimize Financial and Legal Risk</h2>
<p>Some organizations have faced legal action for not making their websites accessible. Minimizing financial and legal risk is a primary driver for many organizations to commit to making their technology accessible.</p>
<p>Some websites are required by law to be accessible. For a list of governmental laws and policies relating to web accessibility in countries and regions around the world, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/">Web Accessibility Laws &amp; Policies</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the legal requirements for an organization might not be clear. Some organizations determine that it is in their best interest to make their websites accessible, rather than risk legal action.</p>

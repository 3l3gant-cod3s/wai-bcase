## To Meet Diversity Goals, Accessibility is Good Business. 

Many businesses have learned that they are stronger and more able to adapt to the rapidly changing modern world by fostering a culture of diversity — the appreciation and embrace of individual differences.  Most often used to refer to differences such as ethnicity, gender, age and religion, when diversity also encompasses the range of individuals' unique attributes and abilities, companies realize unanticipated benefits. Numerous studies document the major dimensions of diversity and highlight business benefits. Several also discuss practical steps to incorporate diversity into companies of various sizes and prompt for personal embrace of diversity. What is too often overlooked is the importance of disability inclusion in diversity efforts. By embracing disability as a natural part of diversity, companies broaden their understanding of the world, they increase access to a broader base of loyal employees, and they enhance their corporate or social image. 

As companies implement accessibility and inclusion efforts, it is not unusual to encounter resistance. People who have no direct experience with disability may not see the importance of dedicating valuable resources to implementing digital accessibility. They may have trouble understanding the relevance and may even feel threatened. Integrating accessibility into a larger narrative of diversity and inclusion can help diffuse some fears, but leaders should not lose sight of the distinct access needs that must be met to succeed in disability inclusion. One of the surest ways to demonstrate the value of the accessibility effort is to ensure that people with disabilities are fully integrated into the workplace as colleagues.  

### Case Study
@@@ Tim Horton's restaurant chain, 6 stores in Toronto. 210 employees, 33 with disabilities. Served in all capacities from line servers to managers. Average employee turnover for this chain was 75-80% each year, but these franchises had only 38%. Enormous cost savings annually. Surveys showed that the disabilty inclusion effort made all employees - including those who had no disability - feel part of something special, that they were working with employer who cared. Production teams that included people with disabilities excelled, stores had a broader cusomer base, increased customer loyalty, were more profitable.[Mark Wafer Testimonial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ovIrGwgHM)@@@

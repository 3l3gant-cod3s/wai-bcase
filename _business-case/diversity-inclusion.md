## To Meet Diversity Goals, Accessibility is Good Business. 

Many businesses have learned that they are stronger and more able to adapt to the rapidly changing modern world by fostering a culture of diversity — the appreciation and embrace of individual differences.  Most often used to refer to differences such as ethnicity, gender, age and religion, when diversity also encompasses the range of individuals' unique attributes and abilities, companies realize unanticipated benefits. Numerous studies document the major dimensions of diversity and highlight business benefits. Several also discuss practical steps to incorporate diversity into companies of various sizes and prompt for personal embrace of diversity. What is too often overlooked is the importance of disability inclusion in diversity efforts. By embracing disability as a natural part of diversity, companies broaden their understanding of the world, they increase access to a broader base of loyal employees, and they enhance their corporate or social image. 

As companies implement accessibility and inclusion efforts, it is not unusual to encounter resistance. People who have no direct experience with disability may not see the importance of dedicating valuable resources to implementing digital accessibility. They may have trouble understanding the relevance and may even feel threatened. Integrating accessibility into a larger narrative of diversity and inclusion can help diffuse some fears, but leaders should not lose sight of the distinct access needs that must be met to succeed in disability inclusion. One of the surest ways to demonstrate the value of the accessibility effort is to ensure that people with disabilities are fully integrated into the workplace as colleagues.  

### Case Study - Canadian Restaurant Chain
This example is not specific to digital inclusion, but illustrates how the integration of people with disabilities into a workforce has made a company stronger. Tim Horton's is a Canadian restaurant chain that includes six stores in Toronto. The Toronto stores are franchised to Mark Wafer, an owner/manager with a commitment to inclusion.  His store employees 210 people, 33 of whom have a disability. Disabled employees serve in all capacities - from line servers to managers. Compare his employment outcomes to the rest of the Tim Horton's chain:
* Average employee turnover company wide is 75-80% each year yet Mark's stores have only 38% turnover
* Cost savings annually is enormous since he estimates $4000 per employee onboarding
* Employees surveys demonstrated that that the disabilty inclusion effort made all employees - including those who had no disability - feel part of something special
* Employee opinion was that they were working with employer who cared - increased loyalty to the compnay.
* Production teams that included people with disabilities excelled
* Stores broadened customer base, increased customer loyalty, were more profitable.

The [Mark Wafer Testimonial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ovIrGwgHM) is clear indication that this employer's understanding is that he has made a good business decision.

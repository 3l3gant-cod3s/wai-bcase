The web is social. People all over the world are becoming more easily connected to one another. As more diverse people are connected, we all benefit. The Forbes Global Diversity and Inclusion Report documented as long ago as 2012 that diversity is good for business performance. Diversity initiatives at companies all over the world demonstrate that companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion:

* Perform better financially,
* Are more favorably viewed by wider groups of customers and vendors,
* Have higher employee retention rates,
* Enjoy greater customer loyalty,
* Support firm internationalization

Diversity means including the perspective and experience of people with disabilities. Accessible web sites are a necessary component of successful diversity initiatives.

Web accessibility focuses on people with all types of disabilities - visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities - including older people with age-related impairments.

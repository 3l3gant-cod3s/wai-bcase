## To Meet Diversity Goals, Accessibility is Good Business. 

Many businesses have learned that they are stronger and more able to adapt to the rapidly changing modern world by fostering a culture of diversity â€” the appreciation and embrace of individual differences.  Most often used to refer to differences such as ethnicity, gender, age and religion, when diversity also encompasses the range of individuals' unique attributes and abilities, companies realize unanticipated benefits. Numerous studies document the major dimensions of diversity and highlight business benefits. Several also discuss practical steps to incorporate diversity into companies of various sizes and prompt for personal embrace of diversity. What is too often overlooked is the importance of disability inclusion in diversity efforts. By embracing disability as a natural part of diversity, companies broaden their understanding of the world, they increase access to a broader base of loyal employees, and they enhance their corporate or social image.

Everyone has a disability at some time in their lives. A temporary injury, age related impairment, or specific disabling situation such as sun glare on a screen will impact how users interact with web sites and applications. Companies that integrate accessibility into project requirements and quality assurance testing will reach larger markets and provide more satisfying user experience for all of their customers and other stakeholders.

## To Increase Market Reach, Accessibility is Good Business

The market of people with disabilities is large and growing as the global population ages.
* One billion people - 15% of the world's population - have a recognized disability (source: [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability))
* As the population ages, many more acquire disability and yet do not identify as a "person with a disability" (source: [AbilityNet](https://digileaders.com/the-business-case-for-accessibility-and-inclusive-design/))
* In countries with life expectancies over 70 years of age, people spend 11.5 per cent of their life span living with disability. (source: [Disabled World](https://www.disabled-world.com/calculators-charts/wpc.php))
* Globally, the extended market is estimated at 2.3 billion people who control an incremental $6.9 trillion in annual disposable income. (source: [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gaudianohunt/2016/10/31/richard-branson-supports-disabilities/#3fe3d1d8788e))

### Case Study - London Olympics 2012
The Olympic Games have an unfortunate history when it comes to web accessibility and have tried to make online communications more accessible since the disastrous Summer Games of 2000 in Sydney Australia. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) was the organisation responsible for overseeing the planning and development of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in London, England. LOCOG had insisted on very clear accessibility requirements in their contracts - a minimum of WCAG2.0 AA compliance for each one.

Working with the advocacy group AbilityNet, LOCOG made sure that designers and developers understood accessibility requirements not just in principle but in how they were applied to new and often complex digital projects. Accessibility experts reviewed wireframes, shared code and best practise guidelines, and delivered formal and informal training to ensure that teams would deliver to the technical standards required. The results broke all previous records for Olympic website views. The official Olympic Games website :
* had 431 million visits over the course of 16 days,
* there were 4.73bn page views,
* 15 million downloads of apps, and
* over 4.7m social media followers.

During the Paralympic Games:
* there were 30 million website visits,
* 9.5m unique users, 
* more than 220 million page views, and 
* 5.8m upgrades of apps.

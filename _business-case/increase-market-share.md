## To Increase Market Share, Accessibility is Good Business

Everyone has a disability at some time in their lives. A temporary injury, age related impairment, or specific disabling situation such as sun glare on a screen will impact how users interact with web sites and applications. Companies that integrate accessibility into project requirements and quality assurance testing will reach larger markets and provide more satisfying user experience for all of their customers and other stakeholders.

The market of people with disabilities is large and growing as the global population ages.
* One billion people, 15% of the world's population have a recognized disability (source: [http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability] The World Bank)

* In countries with life expectancies over 70 years of age, people spend on average about 8 years, or 11.5 per cent of their life span, living with disabilities.

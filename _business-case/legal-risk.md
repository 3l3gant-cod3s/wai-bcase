Legal risk is a strong driver for companies to commit to and maintain accessibility policies and standards. Among drivers for the legal aspect of a business case are these:
* The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150), adopted by the UN in 2006, explicitly references access to communications technology as a human right in the modern world. 
* Ratified by more than 150 nations, the Convention is a powerful influence on the global legal and policy landscape related to web accessibility. 
* In the United States, courts are interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act to be applicable to the web.
* Globally, accessibility is mandated by the European Accessibility Act and similar laws are in place or in progress in Canada, Japan, Australia and elsewhere. 

Countries around the globe are implementing the UN Convention through laws and government policies. In many countries, such laws extend beyond government sites and services to inlcude mandates for businesses that offer goods and services on the web.

### Legal Landscape
For much of the first decade of the 21st Century, the legal risk was seen to be relatively small for maintaining an inaccessible web site. Change occured relatively slowly:
* Early 2000s in the US, a few legal actions related to inaccessible websites based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for US government entities. 
* Complaint put to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) in 2000 about inaccessibility of Sydney Olympics claimed violation of  Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth DDA). 
* Despite several encouraging victories in US courts for people with disabilities seeking equal access, Section 508 was seen to have limited scope and the ADA was unevenly applied by various courts.

Legal risk seemed to increase however with the adoption in 2006 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD). 
* CRPD ratified by more than 140 countries by 2016. 
* Comprehensive human rights document that includes direct reference to the rights of all people to have equal access to communications technology. 

As a result, there is a global increase in legislation that further defines digital accessibility and creates enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with new laws. In addition, the many legal precedents in the United States continue to accumulate and the landscape is changing in favor of equal access. 

With legal risks increasing, it is no wonder that smart businesses, particularly those with global activities, are creating accessiblity policies and programs to mitigate risk in order to protect both their assets and their reputations. 

### Case Study - NPR weekly broadcast of This American Life

A popular broadcast on US National Public Radio (NPR), This American Life is heard on more than 500 stations by about 2.1 million listeners each week. In 2011, in response to new FCC regulations around broadcast media, they committed to creating transcripts for their entire archive of recorded programs. A several month study conducted by their media partner concluded that the provision of transcipts not only met legal obligations but returned significant benefits including:

* search traffic increased 6.86%,
* better comprehension for visitors who know English as a second language,
* visitors able to use transcripts in noisy or sound-sensitive environments,
* ability to more easily translate, and
* ability to search text to reference a specific section of audio. 

The study conducted over more than one year, used Google analytics to capture the following data:
* visitor engagement increased 7.23%, 
* unique visitors increased 4.18%, and
* new inbound links to transcript accounted for increase of 3.89%

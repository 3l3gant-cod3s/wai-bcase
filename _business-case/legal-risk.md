## To Avoid Legal Risk, Accessibility is Good Business


Adherance to the law is a basic principle of good business. Business entities and organizations of all types monitor the legal environment in which they operate. Well managed businesses understand current legal statutes and relevance to their operation. It is common for successful enterprises to track legal trends, anticipate changes in the law that may impact their effectiveness, and safeguard their reputations by not violating legal norms. 

For much of the first decade of the 21st Century, the legal risk was seen to be relatively small for maintaining an inaccessible web site. Other than a few actions based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States, and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for US government entities, there was little evidence of substantial global legal effort related to accessibility. Despite several encouraging victories in US courts for people with disabilities seeking equal access, Section 508 was seen to have limited scope and the ADA was unevenly applied by various courts.

Legal regulation began to increase however with the adoption in 2006 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD). By 2017, the CRPD had been ratified by more than 140 countries. The CRPD is a comprehensive human rights document that includes direct reference to the rights of all people to have equal access to communications technology. As a result, there is a global increase in legislation that further defines digital accessibility and creates enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with new laws. In addition, the many legal precedents in the United States continue to accumulate and the landscape is changing in favor of equal access. 

With legal risks increasing, it is no wonder that smart businesses, particularly those with global activities, are creating accessiiblity policies and programs to mitigate risk in order to protect both their assets and their reputations.

## Introduction
{:#intro}

This page is part of a resource suite that describes the
[**social**](social-factors.html), [**technical**](technical-factors.md),
[**financial**](financial-factors.html), and legal and policy factors relevant to
[developing a customized business case for Web
accessibility](Overview.html) for a specific organization.

Note that the term "policy" is used broadly in this document to refer to
requirements from governments and other organizations in the form of
laws, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, directives,
communications, orders, or other types of documents, which have
different degrees of authority in different systems.

Legal and policy factors apply differently to specific organizations and
situations. For example, one organization might be required by explicit
government regulations to make its websites accessible, while another
organization follows the Web accessibility policies recommended by its
trade association and required by a partner company.

Many countries are ratifying the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons
with
Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150)
which specifically includes accessibility of the Internet and other
information and communications technology (ICT). Thus, countries that
have ratified the Convention might be introducing new "policies, laws
and administrative measures" related to Web accessibility.

This page provides guidance on addressing legal and policy factors in a
business case for Web accessibility.

## Identifying Legal and Policy Factors for a Specific Organization
{:#custom}

The following questions help identify how the legal and policy aspects
of Web accessibility apply to the organization:

-   **Is the organization required by law or other legal mandate to make
    its website accessible?**<br>
    If so, the business case can list those laws or mandates that the
    organization is required to meet. See [Determining Applicable
    Policies](#apply).
-   **Are there other Web accessibility policies the organization should
    comply with?**<br>
    If so, the business case can list those policies that the
    organization should comply with. See [Determining Applicable
    Policies](#apply).
-   **Are the requirements adequate to meet the needs of people with
    disabilities and older users?**<br>
    If the required guidelines might not adequately meet the needs of
    the website's users with some disabilities, the organization can
    include in its business case additional guidelines it chooses to
    meet. See [Considerations Beyond Requirements](#beyond).
-   **Are there specified guidelines, conformance levels, and dates for
    compliance?**<br>
    For example, does the policy state that a certain level of
    compliance is required by one date, and a higher level of compliance
    is required by a later date? See [Considerations for the
    Future](#future).
-   **Might the org be subject to policies in the future?**<br>
    For example, requirements might be in development now that will be
    enforced in the future; or, an organization might expand into
    countries or other markets where Web accessibility policies already
    apply. See [Considerations for the Future](#future).
-   **Does the organization understand the risks of failing to provide
    accessible websites?**<br>
    In some cases it is useful to include in a business case the
    negative impact on reputation and potential legal costs associated
    with defending against legal action for not complying with Web
    accessibility requirements. See [Understanding Risks for
    Non-Compliance](#risks).

## Determining Applicable Policies
{:#apply}

Web accessibility requirements can be in the form of policies, laws,
regulations, standards, guidelines, directives, communications, orders,
or other types of documents. [Web Accessibility Laws and
Policies](/WAI/Policy/Overview.html) lists governmental legislation and
related information for many countries and regions.

Some governments have laws that **specifically** require that certain
types of websites are accessible. For example, some organizations that
receive government funding are required to comply with government
policies on accessibility. Other governments might not directly specify
Web accessibility, yet the web is **indirectly** covered under broader
anti-discrimination legislation, information and communications
technology (ICT) policy, or other laws or policies. In some countries,
organizations' intranets and internal applications are covered by laws
requiring accessibility accommodation in the workplace for people with
disabilities or by age discrimination legislation with respect to older
employees.

An organization might be **required** by non-governmental policies to
make its website accessible, such as a university Web accessibility
policy that requires department websites be accessible. Sometimes
organizations are compelled to meet other policies, such as policies
from trade or industry associations, professional associations, or
standards organizations.

### Considerations for Different Types of Organizations
{:#considerations}

-   **Government**{:#gov} - Some governmental Web accessibility
    requirements apply only to national government ministries' or
    agencies' websites; some also apply to provincial, state, or local
    governments. Some lower levels of government establish requirements
    independent of national requirements.
-   **Education**{:#ed} - Many educational institutions and
    organizations are covered by governmental requirements for
    accessibility of web-based educational resources and online learning
    environments. In some countries or regions, educational institutions
    are covered in broad policies along with other types of
    organizations; and in others there are policies specifically
    addressing educational institutions. In addition to governmental
    requirements, some educational institutions and organizations have
    established separate or more extensive requirements for
    accessibility. In some cases there is a specific policy on Web
    accessibility; in other cases Web accessibility is covered under
    broader accessibility policies.
-   **Industry and Non-Governmental (Non-Profit)
    Organizations (NGO)**{:#organizations} - Some government policies require industry
    and NGO websites to be accessible. These types of organizations
    might also choose to follow other Web accessibility policies, such
    as recommendations from trade, industry, or professional
    associations. Many corporations and NGOs establish their own
    policies for Web accessibility, which are often more extensive than
    those required by government policies. In some cases, policies
    established by corporations or NGOs might also apply to
    subsidiaries, vendors, and others who do business with the
    organization.

### Considerations Beyond Requirements
{:#beyond}

Sometimes the required standards or minimum conformance level might not
adequately meet the needs of the website's users with disabilities. If
the needs of people with some disabilities are left out of the required
accessibility standards, an organization might choose to meet additional
guidelines in order to provide sufficient accessibility.

### Considerations for the Future
{:#future}

It is almost always significantly easier, more effective, and less
expensive to incorporate accessibility early in website development or
redesign, rather than retrofit existing sites later. Therefore, many
organizations that might be subject to Web accessibility requirements in
the future choose to incorporate Web accessibility as soon as feasible.

An organization might be subject to additional Web accessibility
requirements in the future because:

-   there are policies in development that will apply to the
    organization
-   the organization expands into countries or other markets where Web
    accessibility policies apply

Some policies reference specific guidelines or standards for Web
accessibility and include dates for compliance. For example, a policy
might state that websites meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG)](/WAI/intro/wcag.php) WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria by a
certain date and Level AA success criteria by a later date. However, an
organization might determine that it is most efficient to address all
the requirements at the same time.

## Addressing Multiple Standards
{:#multiple}

As described above, an organization could be subject to multiple Web
accessibility policies; for example, standards from governments in
different counties where they operate, from a trade association, and
from a partner organization. Addressing different standards is more
complex than addressing a single standard; however, because there is
almost always significant overlap between standards, the work to meet
two different standards is not twice the work to address one standard.
In most cases an organization meeting the more comprehensive standard
can easily ensure that other standards are also met.

For organizations that are concerned about meeting multiple standards,
it can be effective to include in the business case detail on the
overlap between standards. For example, include an appendix that shows
the similarities between the different standards that shows where it is
not much more effort to meet multiple standards.

## Understanding Risks for Non-Compliance
{:#risks}

Some organizations have faced legal action for not making their websites
or intranets and web-based applications accessible. Not complying with
accessibility requirements can result in significant legal costs and
have negative impact on the organization's reputation.

Sometimes the legal requirements for an organization might not be clear.
**Some organizations determine that it is in their best interest
(financially and otherwise) to make their sites accessible, rather than
risk legal action.**

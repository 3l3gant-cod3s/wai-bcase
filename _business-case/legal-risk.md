Legal risk is a strong driver for companies to commit to and maintain accessibility policies and standards. Among drivers for the legal aspect of a business case are these:
* The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150), adopted by the UN in 2006, explicitly references access to communications technology as a human right in the modern world. 
* Ratified by more than 150 nations, the Convention is a powerful influence on the global legal and policy landscape related to web accessibility. 
* In the United States, courts are interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act to be applicable to the web.
* Globally, accessibility is mandated by the European Accessibility Act and similar laws are in place or in progress in Canada, Japan, Australia and elsewhere. 

Countries around the globe are implementing the UN Convention through laws and government policies. In many countries, such laws extend beyond government sites and services to inlcude mandates for businesses that offer goods and services on the web. 

@@@ will add slected text from previous "legal Aspects" section of previous version as well as references to research and artcles on EO Biz Case wiki page.

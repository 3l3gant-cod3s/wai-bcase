Industry leaders understand that accessibility can be an innovation driver – enabling elegant solutions to unanticipated problems. Historically, people with disabilities often drive innovation due to the fact that many posess an elevated level of creativity and problem-solving that has been naturally developed to overcome daily challenges. Examples of people with disabilities leading advances in science, technology and other fields are numerous. As well, designing for disability introduces constraint, and solving for constraint spurs inventive solutions.

### To Drive Innovation, Accessibility is Good Business

Studies demonstrate that integrating accessibility support innovation in these ways:
* Removing architectural, digital and social barriers increases growth and sparks innovation.
* Designing "for the margins" creates products that work more effectively for larger audiences.
* Accessible design thinking introduces flexibility in interaction design that is useful beyond the disabled community.
* Innovations like the typewriter, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls originally meant as accomodations for disability, soon found wider application.
* Problem solving "outside the box" to meet disability needs anticipates temporarily disabling conditions such as noisy or too bright environments.

Accessible design is by nature flexible, allowing content to be able to be faithfully rendered across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. A business with accessible web sites and applications can increase its market share by several million people with disabilities – a market that Fortune magazine estimates at $200&nbsp;billion per year in the United States alone. 

### Case Study - Google
A 2016 article from Co.Design, the newsletter of FastCompany magazine, is called "How Designing For Disabled People Is Giving Google An Edge." The short article profiles the ways in which Google's investment in accessibility provides the company with an innovation edge in a broad array of products and services. Eve Andersson, the lead engineer featured in the article, stated unequivocally that "the accessibility problems of today are the mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow." Among the innovations that she cites as examples are these:
* contrast minimums help all people see in bright light glare situations
* auto-complete, initally provided for disabled, is now widely used by all
* voice control, implemented for blind users, has been more widely adopted as a great convenience by millions of others 
* artificial intellegence advances based on research originally done to provide visual context to blind users
* driverless cars, meant to support blind people, are projected to help solve traffic fatalities and congestion
* machine learning, initally developed for auto-captioning for the deaf, is now being turned to broader applications

The article ends as Anderson says “I’m passionate about accessibility, not just because I believe in a level playing field, but because (it) makes life more livable for everyone.”

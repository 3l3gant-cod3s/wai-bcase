Industry leaders understand that baked-in accessibility is an innovation driver – enabling elegant solutions to unanticipated problems. Historically, people with disabilities often drive innovation. Designing for disability introduces constraint, and embracing constraint spurs inventive solutions. Examples of people with disabilities leading advances in science, technology and other fields are numerous. Among the reasons to support integrating accessibility into design thinking are these:
* Removing architectural, digital and social barriers increases growth and sparks innovation.
* Designing "for the margins" creates products that work more effectively for larger audiences.
* Accessible design thinking introduces flexibility in interaction design that is useful beyond the disabled community.
* Innovations like the typewriter, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls originally meant as accomodations for disability, soon found wider application.
* Problem solving "outside the box" to meet disability needs anticipates temporarily disabling conditions such as noisy or too bright environments.

Accessible design is by nature flexible, allowing content to be able to be faithfully rendered across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. A business with accessible web sites and applications can increase its market share by several million people with disabilities – a market that Fortune magazine estimates at $200&nbsp;billion per year in the United States alone.

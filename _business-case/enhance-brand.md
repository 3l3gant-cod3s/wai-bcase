Many businesses have learned that they are stronger and more able to adapt to the rapidly changing modern world by fostering a culture of diversity — the appreciation and embrace of individual differences.  Most often used to refer to differences such as ethnicity, gender, age and religion, when diversity also encompasses the range of individuals' unique attributes and abilities, companies realize unanticipated benefits. Numerous studies document the major dimensions of diversity and highlight business benefits. Several also discuss practical steps to incorporate diversity into companies of various sizes and prompt for personal embrace of diversity. What is too often overlooked is the importance of disability inclusion in diversity efforts. By embracing disability as a natural part of diversity, companies broaden their understanding of the world, they increase access to a broader base of loyal employees, and they enhance their corporate or social image.

## To Enhance Your Brand, Accessibility is Good Business. 
The web is social. More than ever, people are connected through technology and increased connectivity promotes diversity, which is of tremendous benefit to society. In 2012, the Forbes Global Diversity and Inclusion Report documented that diversity improves business performance. Diversity initiatives at companies all over the world provide return on investment including the following demonstrated benefits. Companies with strong diversity programs:
* perform better financially,
* are more favorably viewed by wider groups of customers and vendors,
* have higher employee retention rates,
* enjoy greater customer loyalty, and
* faciliate company internationalization.

Successful diversity programs incude the perspective and experience of people with disabilities. Accessible web sites and web based workplace tools are therefore a necessary component of diversity initiatives. 

As companies implement accessibility and inclusion efforts, it is not unusual to encounter resistance. People who have no direct experience with disability may not see the importance of dedicating valuable resources to implementing digital accessibility. They may have trouble understanding the relevance and may even feel threatened. Integrating accessibility into a larger narrative of diversity and inclusion can help diffuse some fears, but leaders should not lose sight of the distinct access needs that must be met to succeed in disability inclusion. One of the surest ways to demonstrate the value of the accessibility effort is to ensure that people with disabilities are fully integrated into the workplace as colleagues.  

### Case Study - Barclays Bank
Barclays plc is a British multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in London. It has operations in over 40 countries and employs approximately 120,000 people. Apart from investment banking, Barclays is organised into four core businesses: personal banking, corporate banking, wealth management, and investment management. In recent years, Barclays has made a strong commitment to diversity initiatives that explicitly work to understand and meet the needs of potential staff with disabilities that inlcudes:
* apprentice programs and internships,
* partnering efforts with disability advocacy organizations, 
* inclusive hiring orientation to HR staff, 
* creation of EmployABLE online magazine, and other staffing innovations

As a result, Barclays has increased and retained higher numbers of people with disabilities. "In the UK...fewer than half of people of working age with disabilities are employed. At Barclays we believe this represents a vital opportunity and untapped pool of talent that businesses can use to thrive."

Your brand is the perception that people have when they hear or think of your company or institution name, service, or product. There are many aspects to the reputation of a brand and successful ones come from companies that understand their stakeholders - what they want, what they need, and how to connect emotionally. A commitment to accessibility serves to enhance an institutional brand in two important ways:
* Demonstrate an investment in diverstiy and inclusion
* Exemplify corporate social responsibility (CSR)

This article explores the ways accessibility enhances and protects the brand of institutions of all sizes and purposes.

## To Enhance Your Brand, Accessibility is Good Business. 
### Accessibility is integral to diversity and inclusion 
The web is social. More than ever, people are connected through technology and increased connectivity promotes diversity, which is of tremendous benefit to society. In 2012, the Forbes Global Diversity and Inclusion Report documented that diversity improves business performance. Diversity initiatives at companies all over the world provide return on investment including the following demonstrated benefits. Companies with strong diversity programs:
* perform better financially,
* are more favorably viewed by wider groups of customers and vendors,
* have higher employee retention rates,
* enjoy greater customer loyalty, and
* faciliate company internationalization.

Successful diversity programs incude the perspective and experience of people with disabilities. Accessible web sites and web based workplace tools are therefore a necessary component of diversity initiatives. 

As companies implement accessibility and inclusion efforts, it is not unusual to encounter resistance. People who have no direct experience with disability may not see the importance of dedicating valuable resources to implementing digital accessibility. They may have trouble understanding the relevance and may even feel threatened. Integrating accessibility into a larger narrative of diversity and inclusion can help diffuse some fears, but leaders should not lose sight of the distinct access needs that must be met to succeed in disability inclusion. One of the surest ways to demonstrate the value of the accessibility effort is to ensure that people with disabilities are fully integrated into the workplace as colleagues.  

### Accessibility exemplifies Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
In a competitive marketplace, brand associations become important in distinguishing products or services. Your brand can stand out based on how it is perceived to be socially responsible. Choices are often influenced by the emotional connection people feel to a brand. That connection can be fostered by how the company is seen to be serious about social issues.

### Case Study - Barclays Bank
Barclays plc is a British multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in London. It has operations in over 40 countries and employs approximately 120,000 people. Apart from investment banking, Barclays is organised into four core businesses: personal banking, corporate banking, wealth management, and investment management. In recent years, Barclays has made a strong commitment to diversity initiatives that explicitly work to understand and meet the needs of potential staff with disabilities that inlcudes:
* apprentice programs and internships,
* partnering efforts with disability advocacy organizations, 
* inclusive hiring orientation to HR staff, 
* creation of EmployABLE online magazine, and other staffing innovations

As a result, Barclays has increased and retained higher numbers of people with disabilities. "In the UK...fewer than half of people of working age with disabilities are employed. At Barclays we believe this represents a vital opportunity and untapped pool of talent that businesses can use to thrive."

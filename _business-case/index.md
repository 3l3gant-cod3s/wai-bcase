## Accessibility is Good Business

Web accessibility advocates often point to the “Business Case” for accessibility and have done so for decades. To be credible, the Business Case must show measurable return on time and effort that businesses invest to implement accessibility. The articles in this series define terms, summarize existing evidence, and point to research and business outcomes from those who have made such investment. We invite the community to read, learn, and contribute their own examples.  

Accessible design benefits organizations of every type and size. An array of practical reasons should encourage them all to build and maintain web sites and applications that meet the needs of the broadest range of users, regardless of ability. Whether your organization is a large for-profit corporation, a small retail or service provider, a school or university, a government entitiy, or a non-profit organization, you will realize significant benefits from implementing accessibility as a foundational business practice. Beyond the humanitarian and compassionate cause of providing equal web access to people of all abilities, the Business Case adds the financial and brand incentives to encourage organizations get started for long term gain. 

The term "accessibility" defines ways to meet the specific needs of people with disabilities. As accessible design has been more widely implemented, it is worth noting that results also improve the user experience for older users, mobile users, new users, people with low literacy, and several other groups at risk of being marginalized. Usabilty studies show improved outcomes for organizations that become adept at attracting, serving, and retaining larger market share by meeting a broader range of user needs. It would appear that accessible design benefits everyone. Let's explore some aspects of what makes this true.

## Web Accessibility is a Performance Driver

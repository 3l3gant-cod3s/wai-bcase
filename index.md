A Business Case is the rationale for initiating a project or task. Whether formal and highly structured or informal and brief, a good Business Case will articulate both tangible and intangible benefits to the business for dedicating resources to a project. To be effective, consideration will be given to cost, benefit, and resource gap analysis. A good Business Case also considers the cost and risk of inaction. As more retail, educational, government, social service, and personal communication activities have moved online, the Business Case for web accessibility is stronger than ever.

This article defines the purpose and provides guidance for how to construct the Business Case for web accessibility that is appropriate and relevant to organizations of different types. Business performance and current research indicates that accessibility integration will help companies realize these benefits.
-   <strong>Drive Innovation:</strong> Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems.
-   <strong>Enhance Your Brand:</strong> Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment.  
-   <strong>Extend Market Reach:</strong> The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users.
-   <strong>Minimize Legal Risk:</strong> Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility and the issue is of increased legal concern.

The article includes statistics, examples, and case studies to illustrate key benefits and risks. Please note that we use "web accessibility" and  "websites" throughout this article and that those terms are meant to includes web applications and other digital technologies as well.

## Who Needs a Business Case for Accessibility? 

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-bcase/chart.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

“Business Case” is a term relevant to organizations and enterprises of all kinds, whether the organization is commercial, educational, non-profit, or governmental. It is the justification for dedicating
resources such as money or effort in support of a specific
organizational need. We will use “business” in this article to refer to
all types of organizations with the understanding that different aspects
will be more or less relevant depending on the organizational focus and
purpose. For example, government businesses may be more committed to the
legal and equity aspects while commercial businesses care more about the
brand enhancement provided by an integrated accessibility program.

Understanding which of the many benefits of web accessibility are most
relevant in your business environment will help you build the most
compelling Business Case for your own situation. Use these resources to
inspire confidence among leaders and decision makers that continued investment in accessibility is good for your business.

<blockquote class="pull alt-2">
  <p>Businesses that integrate accessibility are more likely to be innovative, inclusive enterprises that reach more people with positive brand messaging that meets emerging global legal requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

Research indicates that an investment in web accessibility is part of an
overall strategy that is effective for modern business practice.[^1]
When accessibility is part of strategic planning, businesses are more
readily able to

-   innovate,
-   enhance their brand,
-   increase market reach, and
-   minimize legal risk.

Let’s look at some examples and research outcomes that will help you
make the business case that is most effective in your own environment and
business model.

## Accessibility is good for business

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>Many organisations are waking up to the fact that embracing
accessibility leads to multiple benefits – reducing legal risks,
strengthening brand presence, improving customer experience and
colleague productivity.</p>
  <cite>Paul Smyth, Head of Digital Accessibility, Barclays</cite>
</blockquote>

The sections below explore and provide examples of some key benefits of web accessibility to businesses of all types. How are those realized in the global marketplace?

### Drive Innovation

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-bcase/rocket.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; clear:right; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

Integrating accessibility sparks innovation by removing architectural, digital, and social barriers that can get in
the way.[^2] Some examples:

-   Accessible design thinking leads to flexible interaction options
    useful beyond the disabled community.

-   Innovations like the typewriter, telephone, punch cards, text to
    speech, email, and voice controls were originally meant to include those with 
   disability and all have found much wider application.[^3]
    
-   Accessibility is closely related to general usability — both have interest in defining and delivering an intuitive user experience. Innovation follows as interaction design moves beyond screens and toward interactions that are more human-centered, natural and contextual. 

Accessible design is by nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully
render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive
technologies, and operating systems. In physical environments everyone takes advantage of lower curbs, automatic door openers, ramps, and other features provided for disability access. On the web, accessibility features are also often used by everyone.

For example, in the early 2000’s as the online world increasingly
adopted mobile devices to browse the web, imagine the delight of those
who were already committed to and had designed for accessibility. Accessible, standards-compliant web
sites were in many cases more mobile-ready. This led to the
responsive-design trend that has accessibility at its core.[^4] 

Apple has been an innovator in the accessibility space since the inception of the company. Leaders there anticipated market direction and have integrated disability needs into product development for decades. In the early 2000’s, for example, the 26-campus University of California (UC) system was unable to take advantage of Apple's iPod University program. The application was inaccessible to blind students and so could not be distributed as an offical UC platform. However, Apple had previously identified the gap for blind users and was committed to closing it through innovation for its next generation of products. Apple invested the resources to develop and acquire voice technology that led to VoiceOver and Siri, voice interactions that were enthusiastically adopted by blind users. The UC System was soon able to use the features and wider adoption by the general public played a large part in the development and growth of the mobile web itself. Such advances lead to the wealth of personal digital assistants in many homes and offices. Today everyone can use these innovations, regardless of ability. 
  
#### Case Study – Google

<blockquote class="pull left alt-1">
  <p>The accessibility problems of today are the mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow.</p>
  <cite>Eve Andersson, lead engineer at Google</cite>
</blockquote>

A 2016 article in FastCompany online magazine[^5] highlights the ways in
which Google’s investment in accessibility provides the company with an
innovation edge in a broad array of products and services. Eve
Andersson, the lead engineer featured in the article, say unequivocally
that “I’m passionate about accessibility, not just because I believe in
a level playing field, but because (it) makes life more livable for
everyone.” Among the innovations that she cites as examples are these:

-   contrast minimums, required for people with low vision, help all people see in bright light glare
    situations
-   auto-complete, initially provided for the disabled, is now widely
    used by all
-   voice control, implemented for blind users, has been more widely
    adopted as a great convenience by millions of others
-   artificial intelligence advances are based on research originally
    done to provide visual context to blind users
-   driverless cars, so promising for the independence of blind people, are projected to also
    help solve traffic fatalities and congestion
-   machine learning, initially developed for auto-captioning for the
    deaf, is now being turned to broader applications

### Enhance Your Brand

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-bcase/dna.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; clear:right; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

Fewer things are more important to businesses of all kinds than the protection and enhancement of their brands. A clear commitment to accessibility can demonstrate that a business has a genuine sense of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR.) As businesses understand and act on the diverse needs of their stakeholders and make the commitment to sustainable, inclusive marketing and employment practices, they can achieve a range of benefits. Potential outcomes for CSR programs include enhanced brand image and reputation, increased sales and customer loyalty, improved workforce diversity and many other benefits.[^6]

Further studies[^7] emphasize the benefits to the brand of companies that institute policies of broad diversity. To support employees with disabilities, an important segment of a diverse workforce, the technology that employees use needs to be accessible, including websites and applications.

A well-recognized example is Microsoft. For decades, accessibility
leaders expressed frustration with the gap between what the company said
about accessibility and what it actually did.[^8] Its brand suffered.[^9]
Recently however, Microsoft’s commitment to accessibility has been made
real[^10] and is demonstrated in the genuine engagement with stakeholders of all abilities and the resulting improvements to products and services. Its brand image is stronger and its efforts lauded in the community of people with
disabilities.[^11]

We asked Barclay’s, a W3C member organization, to share their approach to diversity and inclusion through the accessibility initatives in their company. An excerpt from their response is included below.

#### Case Study – Barclay’s Bank
Establishing an organisation-wide accessibility strategy for
identifying, anticipating and addressing the additional needs of
customers and colleagues with impairments contributes in several ways to
our brand identity – through tailored services, fostering an inclusive
culture, creating new ways to communicate and consult with existing and
potential customers. We want to leverage inclusive technology to enable
and empower all people to bank, work and reach their full potential. The
Barclays Accessibility team does this by supporting digital teams to
embed accessibility into our services and culture through effective
governance, partnering, training and tools. Establishing an
enterprise-wide accessibility strategy, standards and programmes coupled
with senior sponsorship helps support our publicly stated ambition of
becoming the most accessible and inclusive FTSE company.

<blockquote class="pull right alt-2">
  <p>At Barclays, accessibility is about more than just disability. It's about helping everyone to work, bank and live their lives regardless of their age, situation, abilities or circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

When we shift our thinking away from the minimum legal compliance to one
focused on the commercial opportunity and the creative challenge that
arises from building better experiences for everyone, we create a more
sustainable, customer orientated approach to digital services. This
requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about accessibility and
in the culture around delivering digital services. To do this we've
identified three main areas of focus to transform our culture based on
the fundamental elements of culture change - Think, Feel and Act. Our
approach to this culture change focuses on:

-   Inspiring Hearts (Feel) - ensuring our colleagues understand the
    impact of accessibility on everyone- not just people with
    disabilities. We use storytelling to bridge the gap that exists
    between our colleagues creating services and our customers using
    them.

-   Educating Heads (Think) - helping our colleagues understand the
    business case for accessibility and the commercial benefits we bring
    by investing in accessible and inclusive products and services

-   Enabling Hands (Act) - giving our colleagues the training, tools and
    processes to make accessibility easier to achieve, repeatable and
    consistent to deliver.

To help everyone understand our accessibility focused mind set, we've
created a range of animations which help our colleagues to understand
what accessibility is all about, who benefits and what the different
types of impairments are. We've also shared these animations on our
[Accessible Banking YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75qKCi59E1U&amp=&list=PLecqH2uhOR0Zb31X7hh5BzWJv4KGLnuUy)

Barclay's is an excellent example of how a strong commitment to accessibility results in distributed responsibility and shared understanding throughout the company culture. 

### Increase Market Reach

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-bcase/chart.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; clear:right; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

The market of people with disabilities is already large and is growing as the
global population ages. In the UK, disabled people and their
families spend at least £249 billion every year, which is known as the
UK Purple Pound. In the US, annual discretionary spending of people with disabilities is over $200 billion. The global estimate of the disability market is $6 trillion, which is equivalent to that of China. Consider these facts when estimating market size:

-   At least one billion people - 15% of the world’s population - have a
    recognized disability[^12]
-   As the population ages, many more acquire disability and yet do not
    identify as a “person with a disability”[^13]
-   In countries with life expectancies over 70 years of age, people
    spend 11.5 per cent of their life span living with disability.[^14]
-   Globally, the extended market is estimated at 2.3 billion people who
    control an incremental \$6.9 trillion in annual disposable
    income.[^15]
    
A Forrester study commissioned by Microsoft concluded that accessibility can contribute to cost savings when it is integrated into existing and ongoing development cycles. [^16] Technology updates and redesigns that include accessibility along with other best practices have demonstrated reduced maintenance, service, and traffic cost. And, according to Microsoft, as accessibility features are included, overall customer satisfaction improves. 

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>Designing inclusive software results in improved usability and customer satisfaction.</p>
  <cite>Microsoft’s app developer guide</cite>
</blockquote>

Accessible design considerations often lead to improvements in general customer experience and customer loyalty. For customers with disabilities, such improvement is essential for equal access. Worth noting as well are the ways in which accessibility provides options that are useful to all customers in various situations. For example, web accessibility also benefits: 
* people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.,
* older people with changing abilities due to ageing,
* people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses,
* challenging situations like bright, glaring sunlight or in noisy environments where audio can't be heard, 
* those with a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth - common in rural areas and some geographical regions.

#### Case Study - NPR weekly broadcast of This American Life

A popular broadcast on US National Public Radio (NPR), This American
Life is heard on more than 500 stations by about 2.1 million listeners
each week. In 2011, in response to new FCC regulations around broadcast
media, they committed to creating transcripts for their entire archive
of recorded programs. A several month study conducted by their media
partner concluded that the provision of transcipts not only met legal
obligations but returned significant benefits including:

-   search traffic increased 6.86%,
-   better comprehension for visitors who use English as a second
    language,
-   visitors able to use transcripts in noisy or sound-sensitive
    environments,
-   ability to more easily translate, and
-   ability to search text to reference a specific section of audio.

The study conducted over more than one year, used Google analytics to
capture the following data:

-   visitor engagement increased 7.23%,
-   unique visitors increased 4.18%, and
-   new inbound links to transcript accounted for increase of 3.89%

### Minimize Legal Risk

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-bcase/scale.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 2rem; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

{::nomarkdown}

A significant demonstration of the risk of ignoring accessibility requirements was the 2008 settlement by the National Federation of the Blind with Target retailers:

- class damages of $6 million
- plaintiff legal fees over $3 million
- undisclosed defense legal fees
- court oversight of website for several years

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

Consideration of the cost and risk of inaction is an important aspect of
any Business Case. The risks are real of ignoring requirements for web accessibility and
the cost can be significant as more regulators recognize the universal
right to participate in online digital information and services.

As web use became more integrated into modern life all over the world, regulators introduced laws and policies to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities. Change occurred incrementally and steadily.

-   Early 2000s in the US, a few legal actions related to inaccessible
    websites based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
    Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for US government entities.
-   Despite several encouraging victories in US courts for people with
    disabilities seeking equal access, Section 508 was seen to have
    limited scope and the ADA was unevenly applied by various courts.
-   Complaint put to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission
    (HREOC) in 2000 about inaccessibility of Sydney Olympics claimed
    violation of Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth
    DDA).[^17]

The 2001 decision in the Sydney Olympics suit[^18] raised awareness of the need to
address accessibility in the emerging practice of web communication. Legal risk became even clearer with the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) and its adoption in the laws and policies of countries around the world.

-   CRPD ratified by more than 140 countries by 2016.
-   It is a comprehensive human rights document that includes direct reference
    to the rights of all people to have equal access to communications
    technology.
-   Number of legal actions in US increase and courts increasingly
    decide in favor of equal access[^19]
-   European Commission adopts European Accessibility Act, requiring
    ATMs and banking services, PCs, telephones and TV equipment,
    telephony and audiovisual services, transport, e-books and
    e-commerce meet accessibility requirements.

As a result, there is a global increase in legislation that further
defines digital accessibility and creates enforcement mechanisms to
ensure compliance with new laws. An example is Norway where it is now illegal for commercial websites to fail to provide equivalent access for people with disabilities. Commercial companies that do not comply are fined by the government.[^20] Austia has had customer protection regulation in place since 2006 requiring most public websites to meet accessibility standards. Customers that believe they have been discriminated against can take legal action. Parties meet in mediation before they are permitted to go to court. In the United States by contrast, the regulation is less clear but legal action continues to accelerate [^21]. Between government oversight and regulation on one hand, and increased legal action on the other, the legal landscape is rapidly changing in favor of equal access.

With legal risks increasing, it is no wonder that smart businesses,
particularly those with global activities, are creating accessibility
policies and programs to mitigate risk in order to protect both their
assets and their reputations.

#### Case Study: Juan Carlos Gil vs. Winn-Dixie retailer

The case was heard in the U. S. District Court of the Southern District
of Florida, Case No. 16-23020. Winn-Dixie is a regional chain of grocery
stores, some of which maintain pharmacies. The blind plaintiff was Juan
Carlos Gil who shopped at the store in person but was unable to access
the website for such information as the store locator, coupons, store
events and specials. The historic suit was the first trial in the
history of the ADA about the accessibility of a public accommodation’s
website. Winn-Dixie asked the court to dismiss the suit based on their
contention that a website is not a public accommodation covered by Title
III of the ADA. The court deemed otherwise, allowed the plaintiff to
recover attorney fee and issued the following:

-   The court concluded that due to the link between the website and
    Winn-Dixie Stores, Title III of the ADA, applicable to “Public
    Accommodations,” did in fact apply in this situation.
-   Required that the website be made accessible to “*individuals with
    disabilities who use computers, laptops, tablets, and smart
    phones.”*
-   Required the store to adopt and post an explicit Accessibility
    Policy *“to ensure the persons with disabilities have full and equal
    enjoyment of its website and shall accompany the public policy
    statement with an accessible means of submitting accessibility
    questions and problems.”*
-   Required annual accessibility training for IT and web staff so they
    learn to create and maintain content that meets WCAG criteria.
-   Required third party applications or content posted to the
    Winn-Dixie site must also meet WCAG requirements.

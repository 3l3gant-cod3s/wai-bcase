[**social**](social-factors.html), [**technical**](technical-factors.html),
[**financial**](financial-factors.html), and [**legal and policy**](legal-policy-factors.html) factors
in the business case for Web accessibility. Each page presents different
aspects of Web accessibility along with guidance on developing a
customized business case.

## Introduction
{:#intro}

The Web is increasingly an essential resource for many aspects of life:
education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation,
social interaction, and more. The Web is used not only for receiving
information, but also for providing information and interacting with
society. Therefore, it is **essential that the Web be accessible in
order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with
disabilities**. Indeed, the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150)
(2006) recognizes Web accessibility as a basic human right.

While accessibility focuses on people with disabilities, it also
benefits older users, mobile device users, and other individuals, as
well as organizations. Older users with age-related accessibility needs
are an increasingly important customer base for most organizations, as
the percentage of older users is increasing significantly. Organizations
with accessible websites benefit from search engine optimization (SEO),
reduced legal risk, demonstration of corporate social responsibility
(CSR), and increased customer loyalty.

Organizations can realize substantial return on investment (ROI) that
offset any costs of implementing Web accessibility. In order to be
willing to make the initial investment, many organizations need to
understand the social, technical, and financial benefits of Web
accessibility, and the expected returns. The justification to commit
resources to a project is often called a "business case". Business cases
usually document an analysis of a project's value in meeting the
organization's objectives, the cost-benefit analysis, and the expected
outcomes.

## Factors in a Business Case for Web Accessibility
{:#factors}

The different aspects of the business case for Web accessibility are
presented in detail in the following pages:

-   [**Social Factors**](social-factors.html) addresses the role of Web
    accessibility in providing equal opportunity for people with
    disabilities; the overlap with digital divide issues; and benefits
    to people *without* disabilities, including people using mobile
    devices, older people, people with low literacy and people not
    fluent in the language, people with low bandwidth connections to the
    Internet, people using older technologies, and new and infrequent
    web users.
-   [**Technical Factors**](technical-factors.md) addresses interoperability,
    quality, reducing site development and maintenance time, reducing
    server load, enabling content on different configurations, and being
    prepared for advanced web technologies.
-   [**Financial Factors**](financial-factors.html) addresses the financial benefits
    of increased website use, for example, from engine optimization
    (SEO); direct cost savings; considerations for initial costs and
    on-going costs; and ways to decrease costs, including [developing
    for accessibility and mobile
    together](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap).
-   [**Legal and Policy Factors**](legal-policy-factors.html) addresses requirements for
    Web accessibility from governments and other organizations in the
    form of laws, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines,
    directives, communications, orders, or other types of documents.

To help develop a customized business case, each of these pages starts
with questions to help identify how the factors apply to a specific
organization.

## Developing a Customized Business Case
{:#custom}

An effective business case focuses on the organization's objectives and
motivations. Certain aspects of the value and outcomes of Web
accessibility are more important to one organization than another, based
on its particular situation. For example, one organization's motivation
might be to demonstrate social responsibility by being inclusive of
people with disabilities, while another organization's primary
motivation might be technical quality and meeting international
standards.

Just as organizations' objectives and motivations vary, so do their
business cases for Web accessibility. A customized business case for a
specific organization will have different content and style, and
incorporate different aspects with different emphasis, focused on that
particular organization.

### Examples of How Factors Differ Across Environments
{:#samples}

Examples of different motivations that organizations have for adopting
accessibility and how those can be integrated into a customized business
case are provided below:

-   A **corporation** might emphasize:
    -   financial gains and cost savings from increased web use due to
        increased potential market share, search engine optimization
        (SEO), and increased usability
    -   reducing risk of legal action, high legal expenses, and negative
        image
    -   public relations benefits of demonstrating corporate social
        responsibility (CSR)
    -   benefits of an inclusive workplace that supports employees with
        disabilities
    -   increased productivity from supporting and retaining older
        employees and their experience
-   A **government ministry or agency** might emphasize:
    -   laws and policies that require public services are available to
        all, such as anti-discrimination legislation or information and
        communications technology (ICT) policy
    -   demonstration of social responsibility and provision of
        information and services that are accessible to all citizens
    -   savings from improved server performance and decreased site
        maintenance
    -   benefits from enabling people with disabilities and older users
        to interact with them online instead of more costly ways
-   An **educational institution** might emphasize:
    -   number of students, faculty, or staff with disabilities in
        educational settings as a social responsibility consideration
    -   benefits of Web accessibility to students with different
        learning styles, older computer equipment, or low bandwidth
        Internet connections
    -   benefits to older employees who may be experiencing age-related
        impairments, an increasing percentage of employees as the
        workforce ages
    -   legal or policy requirements
-   A **non-governmental (non-profit) organization** (NGO) might
    emphasize:
    -   social responsibility factors, such as the organization's
        commitment to human rights, including the right to information
    -   organization's interest in ensuring that its materials are
        available to all of its potential audiences
    -   supporting older people with age-related impairments who may be
        donors
-   A **web design business** might emphasize:
    -   competitive advantage and financial benefits of being able to
        meet increasing requests for accessible web design and
        development
    -   technical benefits and long term financial benefits to clients
        of providing sites according to web standards
    -   public relations benefits of being able to support clients'
        interests in demonstrating social responsibility
-   A **small to medium-sized enterprise** (SME) relying on e-Commerce
    might emphasize:
    -   positive impact on search engine optimization (SEO) from
        accessibility improvements
    -   importance of an increasing market among people with
        disabilities and older people who may significantly benefit from
        accessible online shopping
    -   increased general usability and trustworthiness of online
        shopping interfaces from improved accessibility
    -   reduced risk of legal action and negative publicity from not
        complying with anti-discrimination legislation

While your business case may emphasize a few aspects, it is also
important that you include other aspects. For example:

-   An organization with a clear legal requirement for Web accessibility
    might still need a solid cost/benefit analysis to get management to
    commit sufficient resources for an effective Web accessibility
    program.
-   Some commercial organizations might be more responsive to a social
    responsibility argument than to a standard cost/benefit analysis
    when committing to Web accessibility.

## Additional Resources
{:#related}

The following resources provide additional details related to the
business case for accessibility:

[**Web Accessibility for Older Users**: A Literature Review](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wai-age-literature.php)
:   Illustrates the increasing importance of older users online and the
    overlap between the Web accessibility requirements of older people
    with age-related impairments and the provisions of the [Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20).
    Includes statistics about changing demographics and the prevalence
    of impairment with age.

[**Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web**: Making a Web Site Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap)
:   Introduces how websites can more efficiently be designed to be
    accessible from a mobile device and also accessible for people with
    disabilities when developers understand the significant overlap
    between the two design goals and guidelines. Links to more detailed
    technical documents.

**[WAI Resources](http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/)**
:   Lists the primary resources from W3C Web Accessibility Imitative
    (WAI), including several that provide additional information for
    organizations developing a business case.

Business cases are sometimes accompanied by an implementation plan
describing the steps involved in making an organization's website
accessible. A separate WAI resource suite, [Implementation Plan for Web
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/), provides information on
initial assessment, developing organizational policies, training,
selecting authoring tools, and conformance evaluation.
